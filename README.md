Movie Recommendation System
This project is a simple movie recommendation system that suggests movies based on the similarity of their genres and overviews. The system uses the TF-IDF Vectorizer to convert text data into numerical vectors and then calculates the cosine similarity between these vectors to find the most similar movies.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about 10,000 movies, including their titles, genres, overviews, popularity, release dates, and more. The dataset is stored in a CSV file named dataset.csv.

Dataset Columns:
id: Unique identifier for each movie.

title: Title of the movie.

genre: Genres associated with the movie.

original_language: Original language of the movie.

overview: Brief description of the movie's plot.

popularity: Popularity score of the movie.

release_date: Release date of the movie.

vote_average: Average rating of the movie.

vote_count: Number of votes the movie received.

Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values:

The dataset had missing values in the genre and overview columns. These rows were dropped to ensure data quality.

Creating Tags:

A new column tags was created by concatenating the genre and overview columns. This combined text is used to generate recommendations.

Text Vectorization:

The tags column was vectorized using TF-IDF Vectorizer, which converts the text data into a matrix of TF-IDF features.

Cosine Similarity:

The cosine similarity between the vectors was calculated to determine how similar the movies are to each other.

Recommendation Function
The recommend(movie) function takes a movie title as input and returns the top 5 most similar movies based on the cosine similarity score.

Example:
python
Copy
recommend('Cinderella')
Output:

Copy
Cinderella II: Dreams Come True
Cinderella III: A Twist in Time
Cinderella
Donkey Skin
Penelope
How to Use
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommendation-system.git
cd movie-recommendation-system
Install Dependencies:
Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed:

bash
Copy
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Run the Script:
Execute the Python script to generate recommendations:

bash
Copy
python movie_recommendation.py
Input a Movie Title:
When prompted, enter the title of a movie to get recommendations.

Output
The final dataset with the title and tags columns is saved as final_dataset.csv. This file can be used for further analysis or to build more advanced recommendation systems.

Future Improvements
Incorporate More Features: Include additional features like cast, director, and keywords to improve recommendation accuracy.

User Interaction: Build a user interface (UI) to allow users to interact with the recommendation system more easily.

Advanced Models: Experiment with more advanced machine learning models like collaborative filtering or deep learning-based recommendation systems.
